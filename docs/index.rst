django-missing's documentation
==============================

This Django application bundles some common and useful features which have not (yet) found a way into Django itself.

You are invited to contribute your own features so that together we create a powerfull and good library of Django additions. Because sometimes you cannot imagine an useful feature before somebody shows it to you. So it is useful to have all of them collected together.
